## Technique Sessions

### 1. First Principles Thinking

**Description:** Breaking down the fundamental requirements for Gold partner status, stripping away assumptions.

**Ideas Generated:**

1. monday.com wants partners who fill gaps they won't build themselves
2. Focus on areas with loud customer complaints that monday knows they won't develop
3. Google Sheets app succeeds because it fills an exact gap (seamless data sync)
4. Revenue + installs + reviews + innovation = partner ladder progression
5. Quick wins strategy: Build low-effort apps first to generate revenue for bigger plays
6. Pivot broken Dates to Timeline app → Column Casting app (similar idea, bigger market)
7. Fix Quick Access minimally (1000 installs = existing user base worth saving)

**Insights Discovered:**
- The Google Sheets success IS the playbook - it proves the gap-filling strategy works
- There's a ~12x growth gap between current ARR and Gold status
- Small team means focus is critical - can't build everything

**Notable Connections:**
- Implementation work reveals gaps → Apps solve those gaps → Implementations sell the apps
- BMAD method adoption should accelerate development velocity

---

### 2. Role Playing (monday.com Perspective)

**Description:** Thinking from monday.com's viewpoint - what do they want from partners?

**Ideas Generated:**

1. monday wants innovative solutions, not "me too" apps
2. Multiple apps = multiple revenue streams for monday
3. Installation traffic and growth velocity matter
4. Good reviews and responsive customer service are expected
5. Clear path to Gold/Platinum = they earn when you earn
6. Partners who can market themselves are valued higher
7. Clean, clear value proposition is essential
8. Consistent app releases with a visible roadmap builds confidence

**Insights Discovered:**
- LupApps already has credibility: Top Growing App Award 2025
- monday is selective about promotion - not all apps get visibility
- monday wants to see a PLAN, not just a single app

**Notable Connections:**
- Award credibility + roadmap visibility = case for promotional support
- Portfolio expansion signals long-term partnership potential

### 3. Five Whys (Spot-nik Analysis)

**Description:** Deep analysis of why Spot-nik became the only Platinum partner.

**Root Cause Chain:**
```
Platinum status
    ↑
Few apps, deep on big pain points
    ↑
Higher revenue per user, customers pay premium
    ↑
Customers feel "this is exactly what I need" — trust builds
    ↑
Spot-nik understands pain firsthand + builds relationships
    ↑
ROOT: Started with implementations + built community relationships
      (customers, partners, monday.com employees)
```

**Ideas Generated:**

1. Spot-nik started with implementations - learned pain from inside
2. 5 years in the ecosystem = early mover advantage
3. Small portfolio but each app dominates a major pain point
4. Custom emails + Super forms = areas monday supports but not well enough
5. Deep solutions justify premium pricing
6. Customers become "friends" with trusted partners - relationship, not transaction
7. Community relationships (partners, power users) amplify success
8. Internal monday.com relationships provide insights and support

**Insights Discovered:**
- LupApps has the same origin story advantage (implementations)
- You worked at monday.com = dormant connections exist
- Relationships with monday community and employees need reactivation

**Notable Connections:**
- Implementation experience is already an asset - need to leverage it more
- Spot-nik formula = Deep pain understanding + Relationship building → Premium products → Platinum
