# Agent Thinking – Campaign Creation Flow

## Agent
Okay, I need to create this campaign using the brand assets.

We agreed on a story where the dog collects snacks:

- The intro video shows the dog looking around for snacks.
- The game is the dog collecting snacks falling from the sky.
- The win video shows the dog happy with the snacks.
- The lose video shows the dog sad, without any snacks.

## Agent
Let’s start by creating the base images.

- Images are created.
- Images are sent to button segmentation so the buttons are interactive.
- Images are turned into videos.

## Agent
In parallel, the game creation begins.

- A product image is converted into a 3D object for use inside the game.

## Agent
Once the game is completed, several tests are run to ensure everything works correctly.

## Agent
The campaign is ready and shared with the user.

# User Feedback

The user wants to replace a simple falling circle with a 3D dog face.

## Agent
- The agent locates the circle in the game logic.
- A new dog face image is generated.
- The image is converted into a 3D asset.
- The new 3D dog face replaces the circle in the game.
